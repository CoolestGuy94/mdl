# pretty cool email domain list (active and inactive)
some are active, some are new, some are residential, some are paid...
and some are cool.

This is a list of E-Mail domain addresses (that thingy after your username, so like lukas@gmail.com or leak@live.com and similar)
Some of these are available, some of these are residential and require magic numbers to register and some are unavailable now, either due to domain expiry (for example latinmail.com) or due to migration to another service or similar (for example @mac.com and @me.com domains, those migrated to @icloud.com).
